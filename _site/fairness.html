<h2 id="bias-in-machine-learning">Bias in Machine Learning</h2>

<p>Machine learning models are often biased in unintended ways. This tends to come from skewed or incomplete training data. In text classification, this typically happens because of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Gaps in the training data</em>: for example, there are few outright threats of violence posted to wikipedia comments. Thus machine learning algorithms trained on only wikipedia comments will not be good at identifying them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>A biased annotator population</em>: for example, if the population of people creating the training data is skewed toward a particular political orientation, then one might imagine that the annotators will not consider attacks on their political opponents as toxic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We want our models support conversations being more inclusive and allow more points of views to be shared. But unintended biases might lead to application inadvertently doing the opposite. An interactive visualization that explore the risks and impact of bias can be found at the site of <a href="https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/">Attacking discrimination with smarter machine learning</a>. Many good further resources are maintained on the <a href="http://www.fatml.org/resources/relevant-scholarship">FAT ML community resoure page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="are-the-models-biased-in-what-ways">Are the models biased? in what ways?</h2>

<p>The real question about our models is not whether they have unintended biases - we are sure they must - but in what ways are they biased, how much, and what impact does the bias then have? But even identifying if a model carries unintended biases can be difficult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Carrying out a particular analysis that fails to find bias does not mean it is not there. Maybe other methods or additional data might still find bias. There is no conclusive test for a model not having an unintended bias.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are several different concepts for what it means for a machine learning model to be fair, which are not necessarily compatible, as demonstrated in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05807">Inherent Trade-Offs in the Fair Determination of Risk Scores</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For our text classification problems, a natural notion of unintended bias is that the model treats different groups of people differently, for instance by failing to recognize toxic attacks targeting a particular communities. A natural starting point here is to consider groups who are frequently targeted (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class">protected classes</a>).</p>

<p>A second form of bias we want to avoid is with respect to topic: we want to support conversations on any topic. We consider our model topic-biased when it over or under triggers significantly more when being evaluated on conversations concerning that topic.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-identifying-bias-in-models-difficult">Why is identifying bias in models difficult?</h2>

<p>Identifying bias in the annotators who creating the training data is challenging because we typically know little about the annotators, and even less about whether the wider population would make the same judgements. One also has to respect annotators privacy, limit the amount of questions asked, but still try to identify if annotators judgements differ from the wider population. A frequent proposal is to start with basic demographic information, but even getting accurate demographic information from crowdsourcing platforms is difficult as annotator demographic are rarely known at the outset, necessitating annotators self reporting via surveys.</p>

<p>Even if the crowdworkers are perfectly representative of the wide population in their judgements, the raw data they are rating may be insufficient and thus have false correlations. For example, if all comments that mention sexuality are in fact examples of personal attacks, then the training of a machine learning algorithm will likely result in a model that believes any discussion of sexuality is itself toxic. Depending on how such a machine learning model is applied, it might then inadvertently prohibit constructive and important conversations on that topic. This challenge is compounded by the difficulty of even defining the concept of ‘topic’, which is itself a topic of significant focus in machine learning research. And like identifying bias that might stem from crowdworkers not being representative of the wider population, failure to find a bias related to a topic only means that the method used to find it failed.</p>

<p>Finally, the challenges of topic and crowdworker selection biases may intersect: how toxic a comment is perceived by annotators may depend on both the annotator and the topic.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do-about-it">What can we do about it?</h2>

<p>Understanding and mitigating unintended bias requires analysis and scrutiny from an many perspectives. This is one of the key motivations for <a href="https://www.perspectiveapi.com/">opening access to an API that hosts models</a> and creating public datasets like <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox/Data_Release">our Wikipedia datasets</a>. These tools support others researchers to join the effort to understand and address bias in machine learning.</p>

<p>Bias in our models is an active area of research and we welcome others <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox">getting involved in WikiDetox Wiki pages</a> and via <a href="https://conversationai.github.io/">Conversation AI research projects on github</a>.</p>
